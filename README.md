## main featrue of this project

basically most of the average projects generate the final image like those below: 
![image](https://github.com/Jeret-Ljt/average_face/blob/master/readme_materials/1.PNG)
![image](https://github.com/Jeret-Ljt/average_face/blob/master/readme_materials/5.PNG)

but our project's pictures have clear backgrounds which are chosen in the config.py 
and our final images are like those:
![image](https://github.com/Jeret-Ljt/average_face/blob/master/testset/test4/pic_result/result.jpg)
![image](https://github.com/Jeret-Ljt/average_face/blob/master/testset/test1/test_result/mix.jpg)

the first two images in the left are the original images, and the last is the generated one.
